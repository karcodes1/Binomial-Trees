# Binomial-Trees
The construction of binomial trees in excel is a tedius exercise and frequently leads to mistakes. While taking a fixed income class in university I was inspired to write a program to solve these problems. 

The program takes information from the 'tree-input.xls' spreadsheet, where the inputs can be changed. 

After running the program it will return the binomial tree as 'tree-output.xls'
